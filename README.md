# pyprerender
A python prerenderer

## About

Intended to be a fully replaceable [prerender](https://github.com/prerender/prerender) alternative. For now it is very barebones and does not support the majority of the features.

## Install instructions

To install, you can simply use pip:

`pip install pyprerender`

To install a git version, simply do this:

    git clone https://github.com/thingiesmm/pyprerender.git
    pip install ./pyprerender/


## Run instructions

After installing just run `pyprerender-api.py` (You may need to set your chrome bin location by running `CHROME_LOCATION=/my/chrome/location pyprerender-api.py`)

Then you can test it by running `curl "0.0.0.0:8080/render?url=https://example.com"`
